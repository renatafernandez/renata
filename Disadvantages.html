    <p> Though it could seem like the development of social media could be somehting fascinating for us, it has some bad
        aspects that are affecting our lives in a bad way. Some of them are the following:
    </p>

    <h2>○ Addiciton ○</h2>
    <p>
        Social media can produce addiction due to instant gratification, dopamine release, fear of missing out (FOMO),
        endless scrolling, social comparison, notifications, personalization algorithms, escapism, social validation,
        and easy access. It is crucial for users to set boundaries and balance online interactions with real-life
        experiences to avoid the risk of addiction.</p>
         

    <h2>○ Scams ○</h2>
    <p>Social media scams involve deceptive schemes to trick users into providing personal information, money, or
        access to their accounts. Common scams include phishing, fake giveaways, romance scams, investment schemes,
        impersonation, fake customer support, chain letters, and malware distribution. Users must be vigilant, avoid
        sharing personal information with unknown sources, and report suspicious activity to protect themselves from
        these scams.</p>

    <h2>○ Fake news ○</h2>
    <p> Fake news on social media refers to intentionally false or misleading information spread through social
        networking platforms to deceive or misinform users. It can use sensational content to attract attention and
        easily go viral due to the rapid sharing nature of social media. Fake news can exploit confirmation bias and
        impersonate legitimate sources, making verification challenging. It can erode public trust, impact society, and
        cause harm. Users must practice critical thinking, verify information, and report misleading content to combat
        the spread of fake news. Social media companies are also implementing measures to address this issue.</p>

    <h2>○ Cyberbullying ○</h2>
    <p> Cyberbullying through social media involves using digital platforms to harass, shame, or harm individuals. It
        includes abusive messages, public shaming, image-based bullying, and trolling. Cyberbullying can spread quickly
        and cause severe psychological effects. Anonymity and 24/7 accessibility contribute to its persistence.
        Combating cyberbullying requires platform policies, reporting, and promoting a culture of respect online.
        Education is essential to raise awareness and promote responsible behavior.</p>
